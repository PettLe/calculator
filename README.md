Oooh, boyo! Difficult, but not as bad as I feared. Beginner Javascript Calculator is one of those projects that has
horrible reputation as being a nightmare.
To be honest I pretty much did only the minimum requirements. But I tried really hard to make sure that they work
great and there's no underlying bugs!

I could have finished it faster. I've taken two extra days to fix little things that annoyed me. And sure there are still
more. Examples (and notes to self: fix when you come back!): the third row of buttons, uneven to the rest. What's that all about?
And I managed to limit user input, but I would have wanted to add some kind of MAX indicator to the screen when the limit is reached.
And actually managed to do that, but no matter what I tried I couldn't stop it from repeating on every click. Also user can still input multiple
operators in row. Ugly, but doesn't break the function.

This is potentially one of those great portfolio projects, so when I'm ready and more experienced I will come back to add alternative
functions and the optional steps.

I think the code itself is fine and readable, functions and variables describe themselves. Definetly could be more so though. I like how I
utilized arrow functions for the first time independently.
The project as a whole was hard, but not spirit breaking. Almost every step I had to stop and think. Got stuck for a little while, sometimes
Googled and sometimes not, and came up with a solution.
I broke everything into little pieces and solved them (using console.log very succesfully) one by one. And then combined it all.

Hardest thing probably was to make it function so that user could input multiple operators (ex. 5 + 3 / 2). For long time it almost worked, but
it only registered the last operator instead of the first too.
Also had to jump through few hoops to make it so that if user inputs double digits number or more, the calculator saves it to an array as the whole
number instead of just two different ([23] vs. [2, 3]). Adding an extra step with string variable made it work.

The UI could look nicer and I know I'm able to make it a lot better. And later will do that. But for now I just wanted to focus on the hard part and
bigger picture of making a calculator that does what it's supposed to.
